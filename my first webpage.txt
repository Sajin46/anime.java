  Introduction 
   abstraction in java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user
   and shoeing only the functionality to the user;
   
   it can be achieved using abstract class ,method,and interfaces.
   
   An abstract class is a class that cannotbe instantiated by on its own and is meant be inherit by concrete 


  abstraction in java:
      abstraction in java refers to  hiding the implementation details of a code and exposing only the necessary 
information to the user.
      it provides the ability to simplify complex systems by ignoring irrelevant details and reducing complexity.
      java provides many built abstraction and few tools to create our own.
  abstract class:
      an abstract class needs to be a extended   and its methos should be implemented. it cannot be installed ( to access it, it must be inherited from another class);
